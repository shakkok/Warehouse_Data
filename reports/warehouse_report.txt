# Warehouse Data Quality Report

## Description
This report explains the steps taken to clean and validate the warehouse dataset. 
The goal was to detect and fix common data quality issues and produce a clean dataset ready for analysis.

The main tasks addressed:
- Missing or inconsistent quantity and price values
- Inconsistent product names and categories
- Logical inconsistencies between quantity and stock status
- Date format standardization
- Detection and handling of duplicates
- Creation of a clean dataset

---

## Data Overview
- Original dataset: `warehouse_raw.csv`
- Total rows: ~1000
- Columns:
  - `Product_ID` — unique identifier
  - `Product_Name` — name of the product
  - `Category` — product category
  - `Warehouse` — warehouse name
  - `Location` — warehouse location
  - `Quantity` — number of items in stock
  - `Price` — product price
  - `Supplier` — supplier name
  - `Status` — stock status
  - `Last_Restocked` — last restock date

---

## Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Quantity column
- Replaced textual values like `'two hundred'` with numeric values (200)
- Replaced `'NaN'` with `NULL`
- Converted `Quantity` to `INT`
- Filled missing values with the **average quantity per product**

### 2. Product names
- Removed leading and trailing spaces
- Standardized capitalization:
  - First letter uppercase
  - Last letter uppercase
  - Middle letters lowercase

### 3. Category values
- Standardized to capitalized format (e.g., `Clothing`, `Electronics`)

### 4. Product ID
- Checked uniqueness
- Added a new `New_Product_ID` column with unique sequential IDs

### 5. Price column
- Replaced `'NaN'` with `NULL`
- Converted to `DECIMAL(10,2)`
- Filled missing values with the **average price per product**

### 6. Detect inconsistent product information
- Identified products with inconsistent `Category`, `Supplier`, or `Price`
- Standardized product names by adjusting capitalization of last letter

### 7. Supplier names
- All supplier names were already correctly formatted; no changes needed

### 8. Status column
- All status values (`In Stock`, `Out of Stock`, `Low Stock`) were consistent; no changes required

### 9. Last Restocked
- Converted `Last_Restocked` to proper `DATE` format
- Replaced `'NaN'` with `NULL`
- Added a new column `Last_Restocked_Date` and dropped the old column

### 10. Detect possible inventory errors
- Flagged logical inconsistencies between `Quantity` and `Status`
- Created new column `Stock_Level`:
  - `Out of Stock` → `Quantity = NULL`
  - `Low Stock` → `Quantity < 150`
  - `In Stock` → `Quantity ≥ 150`
- Dropped original `Status` column

### 11. Create clean dataset
- Selected all cleaned data into a new table: `warehouse_clean_data`
- Exported to CSV: `warehouse_clean.csv`

## Summary
After cleaning:
- Missing and inconsistent values were corrected
- Product names and categories were standardized
- Logical inconsistencies between quantity and stock status were resolved
- Dates were converted to a standard format
- Duplicate and near-duplicate rows can be further checked if needed
- The cleaned dataset is saved as `warehouse_clean.csv` and ready for analysis

## Notes
- All transformations were performed using SQL Server
- Original raw dataset is preserved in `warehouse_raw.csv`
- SQL queries used for cleaning are available in `cleaning_queries.sql`
